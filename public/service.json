Note that ceramic disc faucets typically come with a lifetime guarantee from manufacturers because they are so durable and rarely need repairs."

Wastewater comes from a variety of sources. Everything that you flush down your toilet or rinse down the drain is wastewater. Rainwater and runoff, along with various pollutants, go down street gutters and eventually end up at a wastewater treatment facility."
